<strong>Abstract</strong>: We propose an end-to-end optimal tangency portfolio (TP) weights construction method that we label as the "Convolutional Neural Network-Efficient Frontier (CNN-EF)" method. This method applies the CNN algorithm on multi-asset return (MAR) images and directly constructs optimal portfolios with max ex-post realized SR. We use 17 industry portfolios as the base assets in an empirical example to demonstrate the superiority of our method in both short- and long-horizon applications. In addition, we consider different levels of transaction costs, proving the robustness of our model even in high transaction cost scenarios. Overall, the CNN-EF method proposed in this paper significantly improves the expected utility for mean-variance investors and can provide investors with an alternative portfolio construction strategy that is efficient and significantly beats the market.\
