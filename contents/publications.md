[[Paper]](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4803039)\
<strong>Abstract</strong>: We propose an end-to-end optimal tangency portfolio (TP) weights construction method that we label as the "Convolutional Neural Network-Efficient Frontier (CNN-EF)" method. This method applies the CNN algorithm on multi-asset return (MAR) images and directly constructs optimal portfolios with max ex-post realized SR. We use 17 industry portfolios as the base assets in an empirical example to demonstrate the superiority of our method in both short- and long-horizon applications. In addition, we consider different levels of transaction costs, proving the robustness of our model even in high transaction cost scenarios. Overall, the CNN-EF method proposed in this paper significantly improves the expected utility for mean-variance investors and can provide investors with an alternative portfolio construction strategy that is efficient and significantly beats the market.\

- <strong>The Time–Frequency Co-Movement Between Bitcoin and U.S. Equities: Evidence from Sentiment Shocks and Safe-Haven Substitution</strong>, with Yike Wang, Valerio Poti\
<strong>Abstract</strong>: This paper investigates the time–frequency co-movement between Bitcoin and the U.S. equity market using wavelet coherence (WTC) and partial wavelet coherence (PCW) methods. The results reveal significant positive coherence, particularly in high- and medium-frequency bands. Controlling for the VIX index notably reduces the coherence, suggesting that shared market sentiment plays a key role in driving the co-movement. Further conditioning on traditional safe-haven assets such as gold and the U.S. dollar index weakens the coherence to a lesser extent, indicating limited substitution effects.
